    <h1>Spring season to flowers</h1>
    <p>For a flower to grow, it needs soil or compost, water, light, and warmth. They receive the conditions they require to start growing in the spring. The rainfall provides them with the water they require. Since there is more daylight and warmth from the Sun throughout the longer days, the temperature of the soil and the air rises.</p>
